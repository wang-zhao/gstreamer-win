= Cleanups =
* often two g_object_set for same object one after the other
* use GST_*_OBJECT () more often
* there are two gst_element_set_state() one after each other

= Renaming =
* internal use of img->image, vid->video

= Refactorisation =
* gstcamerabin:gst_camerabin_rewrite_tags
  - sounds fishy, should use normal tagsetter method
  - gst_camerabin_rewrite_tags_to_bin(9 why don't we just send a tag-event?

* file-name property
  - supplying an already opened filedeskriptor would be more safe
  - need to check what filesink does if the file exists and cannot be overwritten

* imagbin
  - we want async operation here (especialy for burst mode capture)
  - right now, its a bit fragile as we muck with locked_state
  - main problem is that the location for filesink can only be set in NULL/READY
    and we need to do that sync'ed with the dataflow. we can't use multifilesink
    as it does a file per pad_push
  - one problem of the current approach is that we can't have an image in e.g,
    postprocessing while anotherone is beeing saved
  - we could use a pool of imagebins:
    - configure one (set filename)
    - push_buffer
    - on eos, put it back to the pool
    - for this we need to check that we can have multiple instances of e.g.
      dsp jpeg encoders
