/* For the clock skew we use a windowed low point averaging algorithm as can be
 * found in http://www.grame.fr/pub/TR-050601.pdf. The idea is that the jitter is
 * composed of:
 *
 *  J = N + n
 *
 *   N   : a constant network delay.
 *   n   : random added noise. The noise is concentrated around 0
 *
 * In the receiver we can track the elapsed time at the sender with:
 *
 *  send_diff(i) = (Tsi - Ts0);
 *
 *   Tsi : The time at the sender at packet i
 *   Ts0 : The time at the sender at the first packet
 *
 * This is the difference between the RDT timestamp in the first received packet
 * and the current packet.
 *
 * At the receiver we have to deal with the jitter introduced by the network.
 *
 *  recv_diff(i) = (Tri - Tr0)
 *
 *   Tri : The time at the receiver at packet i
 *   Tr0 : The time at the receiver at the first packet
 *
 * Both of these values contain a jitter Ji, a jitter for packet i, so we can
 * write:
 *
 *  recv_diff(i) = (Cri + D + ni) - (Cr0 + D + n0))
 *
 *    Cri    : The time of the clock at the receiver for packet i
 *    D + ni : The jitter when receiving packet i
 *
 * We see that the network delay is irrelevant here as we can elliminate D:
 *
 *  recv_diff(i) = (Cri + ni) - (Cr0 + n0))
 *
 * The drift is now expressed as:
 *
 *  Drift(i) = recv_diff(i) - send_diff(i);
 *
 * We now keep the W latest values of Drift and find the minimum (this is the
 * one with the lowest network jitter and thus the one which is least affected
 * by it). We average this lowest value to smooth out the resulting network skew.
 *
 * Both the window and the weighting used for averaging influence the accuracy
 * of the drift estimation. Finding the correct parameters turns out to be a
 * compromise between accuracy and inertia. 
 *
 * We use a 2 second window or up to 512 data points, which is statistically big
 * enough to catch spikes (FIXME, detect spikes).
 * We also use a rather large weighting factor (125) to smoothly adapt. During
 * startup, when filling the window, we use a parabolic weighting factor, the
 * more the window is filled, the faster we move to the detected possible skew.
 *
 * Returns: @time adjusted with the clock skew.
