Release Notes
=============

* 0.7 "The Big Bump" June, 2011

General notes
-------------

This release enables frame-based multithreaded decoding for a number of codecs,
including VP8, H.263 and H.264. Additionally, there has been a major cleanup of
both internal and external APIs. For this reason, the major versions of all
libraries have been bumped. On the one hand, this means that 0.7 can be installed
side-by-side with previous releases, on the other hand, in order to benefit
from the new features, applications need to be recompiled.

Other important changes are additions of decoders including, but not limited to,
AMR-WB, single stream LATM/LOAS, G.722 ADPCM, a native VP8 decoder
and HE-AACv2. Additionally, many new de/muxers such as WebM in Matroska, Apple
HTTP Live Streaming, SAP, IEC 61937 (S/PDIF) have been added.

See the Changelog file for a list of significant changes.

Please note that our policy on bug reports has not changed. We still only accept
bug reports against HEAD of the Libav trunk repository. If you are experiencing
issues with any formally released version of Libav, please try a current version
of the development code to check if the issue still exists. If it does, make your
report against the development code following the usual bug reporting guidelines.


API changes
-----------

Please see the file doc/APIchanges for programmer-centric information. Note that a
lot of long-time deprecated APIs have been removed. Also, a number of additional
APIs have been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in the next release.
