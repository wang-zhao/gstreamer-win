/**
 * atk_plug_get_plug_id:
 * @obj: an #AtkPlug
 *
 * Gets the unique ID of an #AtkPlug object, which can be used to embed inside
 * of an #AtkSocket using atk_socket_embed().
 * Internally, this calls a class function that should be registered by the
 * IPC layer (eg, at-spi2-atk).  The implementor of an AtkSocket object
 * should call this function (after atk-bridge is loaded) and pass the value
 * to the process implementing the AtkPlug into which the AtkSocket is
 * embedded.
 *
 * Returns: the unique ID for the plug
 *
 * Since: 1.30
